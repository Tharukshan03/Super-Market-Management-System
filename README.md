# Super-Market-Management-System

Project Contribution
This is an academic team project developed as part of our university coursework. My contributions included requirements analysis, workflow design, user stories and acceptance criteria, API validation, testing support, and coordination across frontend/backend tasks.
Supermarket Management System is a full-stack web application for managing products, user accounts, shopping cart flow, and customer orders.

It includes:

- ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- React + TypeScript frontend
- MongoDB database
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Selenium smoke test for product flow

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10
- Node.js LTS and npm
- MongoDB server or MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Google Chrome (for Selenium test)

## Configuration

### Backend configuration file

File: SupermarketAPI/appsettings.json

Key sections:

- ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection
- Jwt:Issuer
- Jwt:Audience
- Jwt:Key
- Jwt:ExpiresInMinutes

Important:

- Use your MongoDB connection string in `ConnectionStrings:MongoDb`.
- Replace Jwt:Key with a strong random secret of at least 32 characters.

### Backend launch URL

File: SupermarketAPI/Properties/launchSettings.json

- Development HTTP URL: http://localhost:5224

### Frontend API URL

File: frontend/src/services/api.ts

- API base URL: http://localhost:5224/api

## Run the Project Locally

### 1) Start backend

~~~powershell
cd SupermarketAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
~~~

Swagger (development):

- http://localhost:5224/swagger

### 2) Start frontend

~~~powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
~~~

Frontend app:

- http://localhost:3000

### 3) Optional Selenium smoke test

Prerequisite: backend and frontend must already be running.

~~~powershell
cd tests/selenium
npm install
npm test
~~~

## Database Notes

The application uses EF Core with MongoDB. MongoDB creates collections when the application first writes data; EF migrations are no longer used.

Ensure the database contains required tables:

- Products
- Users
- Cart
- CartItems
- Orders
- OrderItems

If your local database is fresh, run migrations for EF-managed schema and execute the required SQL setup for manually introduced tables/procedures used by auth/cart/order flows.

## API Overview

### Products (public)

- GET /api/products
- GET /api/products/{id}
- GET /api/products/category/{category}
- GET /api/products/lowstock?threshold=10

### Products (admin/staff only)

- POST /api/products (Admin, InventoryManager)
- PUT /api/products/{id} (Admin, InventoryManager)
- DELETE /api/products/{id} (Admin, InventoryManager)

### Auth

- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/auth/profile (auth required)
- PUT /api/auth/profile (auth required)
- POST /api/auth/change-password (auth required)

### Cart (auth required)

- GET /api/cart
- POST /api/cart/items
- PUT /api/cart/items/{id}
- DELETE /api/cart/items/{id}
- DELETE /api/cart/clear

### Orders (auth required)

- POST /api/orders
- GET /api/orders
- GET /api/orders/{id}

## Frontend Routes

- / (Landing)
- /shop (Customer storefront)
- /admin/products (Inventory list)
- /add-product (Admin/InventoryManager)
- /edit-product/:id (Admin/InventoryManager)
- /register
- /login
- /profile
- /cart
- /checkout
- /orders
- /orders/:id

## Testing

### QA test sheet

Use this file for execution tracking:

- docs/qa-test-sheet-auth-cart-orders.md

### Manual E2E flow

Suggested verification flow:

1. Registration
2. Login
3. Profile update and password change
4. Add to cart and update cart
5. Checkout
6. Orders list and details

## Troubleshooting

### Backend cannot connect to database

- Verify the MongoDB connection string is valid
- Verify the MongoDB database name is correct

### 401 Unauthorized on protected endpoints

- Login first to get JWT
- Ensure Authorization header is present as Bearer token
- Verify Jwt settings are consistent and key length is at least 32 chars

### Frontend cannot call backend

- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:5224
- Ensure frontend API base URL matches backend URL
- Ensure CORS in Program.cs allows http://localhost:3000

### Cart update fails with product mismatch

- Current backend cart update requires the matching productId for the cart item.
- Frontend cartApi resolves this automatically before sending the update request.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit real production secrets to appsettings.json.
- Move JWT key and database credentials to environment variables or secret manager for production.
- Use HTTPS and secure cookie/token strategies in production environments.

## Render and MongoDB Deployment

The `render.yaml` blueprint deploys the ASP.NET Core API from `SupermarketAPI/Dockerfile`.
Create a MongoDB Atlas database, then create the Render service from the blueprint and set:

- `ConnectionStrings__MongoDb` to the Atlas connection string
- `MongoDb__DatabaseName` to the target database name
- `FRONTEND_URLS` to the deployed frontend origin
- `Supervisor__Email` and `Supervisor__Password` to the initial administrator credentials

After Render creates the service, set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in the frontend build environment
to `https://<render-service>.onrender.com/api`. The frontend currently uses its Azure URL only
when this variable is not supplied, so it must be set for the Render deployment.

### Dev note: create an Admin user

Sprint 2 customer registration always creates a Customer account. For local testing of inventory actions,
promote a user to Admin directly in MongoDB.

In the Users table the Role is stored as an integer enum:

- 0 = Customer
- 1 = Admin
- 2 = InventoryManager
- 3 = Cashier

Example:

~~~sql
SELECT id, email, role FROM users;
UPDATE users SET role = 1 WHERE email = 'admin@gmail.com';
